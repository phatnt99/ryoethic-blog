        <p>Ahoy Matey | Hello | Xin ch√†o</p>
        <p>I started out of my comfort zone (University) to walk the path I was passionate about by becoming a PHP web fresher, I learned the basic specialized skills for web development like HTML / CSS / Javascript and PHP (with the Laravel framework - one of my favorites). Most of the time I write API and solve logic problems through PHP code lines.</p>
        <p>Recently I am learning to code with Java, I am a person who loves to code with principles so Java is definitely the next language I want to conquer on the web development path. Right now I'm a Middle Java Developer at FPT Software and I'm curious about the world.</p>
